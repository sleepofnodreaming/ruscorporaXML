# What is ruscorporaXML?

RuscorporaXML is a desktop client for ruscorpora.ru. The program prevents you from turning over multiple pages of ruscorpora's output downloading all the necessary examples as a single XML file. You also can straight away collect some statistics on the data you download.

# Requirements
To run this, you'll need to have Python 2.7 installed. [LXML](http://lxml.de/tutorial.html) (at least v.3.3) is also required.

## Mac OS
If you are on Mac, you should have a Python installed by default. However, you may probably not have an LXML lib. I *strongly recommend* you to update your Python using an installer from the [official Python site](https://www.python.org/downloads/). The latest version of Python contains the package manager `pip`, so you will be able to install LXML by just running the following command in you Terminal: `pip install lxml`.

## Windows
(Un)fortunately, I do not have an active copy of Windows on my computer (and [have nothing to do with it](http://bash.im/quote/436599)), so I cannot instruct you. Contributions are welcome.
