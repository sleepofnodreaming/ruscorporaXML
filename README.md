# What is ruscorporaXML?

RuscorporaXML is a desktop client for ruscorpora.ru. The program prevents you from turning over multiple pages of ruscorpora's output downloading all the necessary examples as a single XML file. You also can straight away collect some statistics on the data you download.

# Requirements
To run this, you'll need to have Python2.7 installed. [LXML](http://lxml.de/tutorial.html) is also required.
